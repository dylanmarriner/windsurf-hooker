## Reporting & Enforcement

### How to Report

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct:

1. **Document the incident:**
   - What happened?
   - When did it happen?
   - Who was involved?
   - What context led to it?
   - Are there witnesses?

2. **Report to:**
   - Email: conduct@project.org (preferred for privacy)
   - Or mention a maintainer privately
   - Or: [Reporting form if applicable]

3. **What to include:**
   - Clear description of the incident
   - Specific messages or comments (if relevant)
   - Impact on you or community
   - Any previous incidents (if pattern exists)
   - Your contact information (kept confidential)

4. **Confidentiality:**
   - All reports are treated confidentially
   - Only reviewed by designated enforcers
   - Not shared publicly without your consent
   - Information limited to what's necessary

### Enforcement Process

**Step 1: Acknowledgment (24 hours)**
- We will acknowledge receipt of your report
- Confirm we're investigating
- Provide timeline for next steps

**Step 2: Investigation (3-7 days)**
- Review reported incident
- Gather context from all parties
- Assess severity and pattern
- Determine what happened and why

**Step 3: Decision (5-10 days)**
- Determine if Code of Conduct violated
- Decide appropriate response
- Notify reporter of action taken
- If appropriate, notify person reported

**Step 4: Resolution (varies)**
- Implement decided action
- Monitor for pattern improvement
- Follow up to ensure effectiveness
- Document for pattern recognition

### Possible Responses

Depending on severity and context:

| Severity | Example | Possible Response |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Minor | Off-topic comment | Private reminder of expectations |
| Moderate | Disrespectful language | Private warning, request for apology |
| Serious | Harassment or threats | Temporary muting/ban from community spaces |
| Severe | Repeated violations or serious harm | Permanent removal from community |

**Note:** Responses are proportional to harm and intent to harm. We prioritize safety of the community.

### Appeals

If you believe a response was unfair:

1. Email: conduct@project.org
2. Include: Why you believe decision was unfair, new information, etc.
3. Timeline: Appellate maintainer reviews within 7 days
4. Decision is final after appeal

## Special Situations

### Conflicts Within the Community

If you're in conflict with another contributor:

1. **Assume good intent** — Misunderstandings happen
2. **Communicate directly** — Tell them how their actions affected you
3. **Listen to their perspective** — They may not have known
4. **Find common ground** — Focus on shared goals
5. **Escalate if needed** — Ask a maintainer for mediation

### Disagreement ≠ Violation

Technical disagreement is healthy and encouraged:

- ✅ "I disagree because..."
- ✅ "Have you considered...?"
- ✅ "This approach has limitations..."
- ❌ "You're wrong" (harsh tone)
- ❌ "Only idiots would suggest..." (personal attack)

### Power Dynamics

Those in positions of authority (maintainers, established contributors) have extra responsibility:

- Model positive behavior consistently
- Be aware of power imbalance
- Assume more generous interpretation from others
- Hold yourself to higher standard
- Use your influence to reinforce code of conduct
